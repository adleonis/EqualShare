## Goals
1. [X] Start thinking & writing
2. [ ] Establish an initial clear list of requirements to become a taxable citizen, and estimate the total number of contributors. This is a first guess which should ultimatly be the result of a real democratic vote through referendum.

4. [ ] Establish an itemized breakdown of the budget per capita, both federal and local.
5. [ ] Propagate content using terms correctly (effective tax rate of the rich as x 1000 % of equalshare)
6. [ ] Establish a calculator where anyone can put in what they currently actually pay in taxes, and shows them where they fall, how much they contribute as a portion of their equalshare. 
7. [ ] Lobby for the equalshare to be divulged on each tax form, as well as each new bill and spend proposed by legislators. Decisions on whether to add to government spending should be framed in terms taxpayers understand.
8. [ ] Implement the program in a small countries or jurisdictions where its consequences can be properly evaluated. Outlaw all other taxes.

## Methods
### A. Flip it
One liners to flip and controverse. 
1. Call out the poor as "Tax Evaders"!
2. Ask people if they believe everyone should pay the same amount of taxes
3. Use radical left words and slogans in their true sense: Power to the people! 
4. The rich are american heros. Whoever pays more than their share should get a medal, and some merch.

### B. Use facts your opponents agree on. Focus on common grounds in fundamental idealogy and goals, not opposites.
1. Do you want a fair tax system?
2. Do you believe in discrimination? Is discrimination on any ground bad?
3. Don't you think everyone should pay the same for the same service?
4. Don't you think politicians have too much control over budgets and that leads to corruption?
5. Do you think your taxes are well used?
6.
