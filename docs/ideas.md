## One Liners:
1. You get what you pay for. Pay your taxes.
2. No more discrimination. EqualShare.
3. Equal Taxes for Equal Representation. (Don't tread on me)
4. How is it that people who pay millions in taxes are called Tax Evaders, while people who pay nothing are called Citizen?


## Framing
Here we position Equal Share in a proper historical framework. We hold EqualShare to be the natural evolution of democracy, towards a fairer, more just and inclusive system.
We will show that while Political Power & Responsability was gradually granted to more and more citizen, from the Greek Democratic System, after the French Revolution, and finally during the American Revolution, Economic Power and Responsability has suffered no such transition. We are still in a feudal economic system when it comes to Taxation. The Feudal Taxation system, whereby the state determines which taxes may be levied, by whom, and from whom, is still in effect and has not evolved. The types, methods, and rates applied have all slightly changed, but the fundamental system has remained. We hold Equal Share to be a drastic improvement and revolution in rights and privileges of citizen in a democratic society. The main demands of Equal Share are to apply the democratic revolution, which has proven itself to be wildly successful, to taxation. 

## Rights, and Responsability.
We hold that the masses, the citizenry as a whole, have been unduly cheated out of their proper responsability. This has created an every increasing and costly political class. This democratic political class, who holds incredible power and is seldom held to the same scruteny as common folk, is not only unjust in its very existence, but also hampers the overall productivity, security and happiness of the citizen. We know, from life experience, that every right also comes with a corresponding responsability. Children and teens will struggle to grasp this, but adults with life experience understand this intrisincally. The right to vote comes with the duty to vote, and the responsability to be informed. The right to vote was fought over and granted, but the responsability to pay for what this vote costs was never levied. The right to vote, to take decisions, to voice your opinion in the matters of the state, was given to everyone. But the ability to determine who should be taxed, and by how much, remained in the hands of our state officials. This is underlying reason for much of today's systemic world problems.

## Towards a Equal Democratic State
A democratic state based on equality of all citizen means that both voting rights and its financial responsability be directly handled by its citizen. This creates immediate benefits for the poor, who henceforth become equal citizen to the rich, no longer useable as pawns of state officials in their endless quest for power. All government spending is to be decided on by direct citizen action, via a quarterly/yearly payment and indication of payment increase/decrease for the following period. The role of the government in an Equal Democratic State is the efficient administration and use of funds for the purposes defined by the people, not the poorly-checked wielding of unlimited power. 

## Implementation

### Preliminary Ideas
1. Establishment of the EqualShare amount, as well as a clear definition of who is taxable under EqualShare.
2. Establishment of the EqualShare breakdown, in terms of how much is to be spent on each governement item. 
3. Establishment of a Goverment Reporting System, wherby the use of funds can clearly and simply be understood by citizen for each taxation period. Reporting must be in real dollars per capita, i.e. the portion of EqualShare.
4. Establishement of Necessary Tarifs and Customs to control national Interests & Sovereighty.
5.  


## Complications in the Economic Machine
It is common policy for economists and politicians to meddle in the lives of citizen according to their moral inclinations by creating social engineering programs of taxation to influence both individual and group action. We understand today that while well-intentioned as they may be, such taxes inevitably create complications, loopholes and strange incentives in the overall economy. The results are often impossible to predict. Nevertheless, they seem popular with some people. It remains to be seen if they survive direct citizen vote, i.e. if once citizen can vote with their dollars if they shall survive. I doubt it, but for the purpose of transition it seems unecessary to completely remove all such taxes immediatly. Those which are well administered by government will remain naturally.
