# The Equal Tax

Some data to frame the discussion based on expected 2022 Budgets. 

The overall US Government budget is actually much higher than incoming revenue. But this is outside of the scope of the changes proposed. There are pros and cons to running a deficit, which have more to do with external and national policy than the internal efficient use of taxpayer revenue. Everyone agrees that in theory the deficit is too high, and that spending within the means of the people is a much safer policy, it's not within the scope of this discussion. Let for the sake of this proposal take the current budget and deficit:

| Year | Spending | Planned Deficit | Planned Tax Revenue |	
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2022 | $6,550,000,000,000.00 | $3,130,000,000,000.00 | $3,420,000,000,000.00 |
| 2022 | $6.55 Trillion | $3.13 Trillion | $3.42 Trillion |

For a needed revenue of $3.42 Trillion US Dollars, the simple EqualShare is easy enough to calculate based on known population data from the last census:

| Year |	Needed Revenue |	Population	| % Taxable	| Taxable Pop.	| Equal Share |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2022 | $3,432,000,000,000	| 328,200,000 |	43.6%	| 143,000,000	| $24,000 |
| 2022 | $3.432 Trillion	| 328 Million |	43.6%	| 143 Million	| $24,000 |

Each US person currently owes $24k US dollars. This is the actual amount attributable to individual costs of the government, keeping with the same deficit-spending trend. For a zero deficit budget(to stop increasing the deficit, not paying it back), it would actually go to $46k. The actual cost of the current government is $46k per taxable US Person. 

**US persons are people who pay taxes in the US. Foreigners who live in the US are considered US persons, while US citizens who live outside the US are not.  

# What about those of us who can't afford to pay $24,000 per year to the government?

This is of course the first shocked response to the Equal Share proposal. It's natural, since the dubious legalization of the income tax in 1913 has created a class of Americans who live on debt, have no savings, and live cash-poor lives. Somewhere between 20-25% of Americans have no savings, and life with constant difficulty to make ends meet. How then can they be expected to afford 50% or more of their yearly income on taxes?

This is the wrong question. The right question is: **How can a country run whereby a quarter of its population is unable to contribute at all to society?** Perhaps 2-3% might be acceptable, but 25% in indicative that something is drastically wrong. Wouldn't it make more sense to create a society where everyone can contribute equally? All this means, is that our concept of what is necessary government spending should be redefined. Not by what politicians decide is best for them to get re-elected, but by what citizen can actually afford. What can be a lofiter goal, and lead towards a more united and peaceful society than to create a government which provides the same services to all citizen, and which citizen share the burden of equally?

If if want a United States of America, then we should want a federal budget which all its citizen can actually afford.

You will naturally respond that Governement is there to help the poor, and that in order to slash the budget, we would have to slash assistance programs to the poor. Actually what we must first recognize is that government helps itself first, then passes on the scraps to the poor, if at all. The EqualShare proposal actually solves the problems of the poor quite simply:
1. markets respond naturally to supply and demand. If the cost of living of the poor is raised by 50%, the prevailing wages for lower income jobs will necessarily raise by 50%. No one works for nothing, and not even the poor will agree to work in order to accrue debt. In effect, the first and incredible outcome of taxing the poor equally to the rich is to make the poor comparatively much richer than before.
2. since employment and wage pressures are lifted from corporations, employers have no incentives to restrict this increase in costs. Currently, taxes on wages are so high that they are a huge burden on the poor, and social security is a regressive tax paid dispropotionately by the poor.

This is not to say that the poor will dissapear. In effect their income will be raised substantially, allowing for them to contribute equally. What remains at year's end and whether it will be greater when adjusted for costs of living is a guess at best. Models could be created to study this. The economy of Switzerland is a good proxy. Costs of living are much higher than neighboring countries, which means the poor enjoy not only a strong and well functioning government, but frequent and pleasureable vacations in neighboring Spain and Greece, where their money goes a long way.

Point 1 above is a well studies and well understood phenomenon. There is no economic debate. Workers of a certain economic or skill-level in an economy are a scarce resource. The impact of supply and demand, fixed and variable costs in the economy is well understood. For example, when the price of lumber, or steel, or cement changes, the corresponding costs of housing increase.
