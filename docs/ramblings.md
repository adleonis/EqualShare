# A simple fair tax for everyone.

## Why?
1. Pride & Democracy, power to the people. A simple direct tax takes the power back from politicians, and into the hands of the people.
2. More productive: huge savings for everyone, more transparent politics/democracy, budget control. 
3. Moral imperative: discrimination on the basis of wealth is still discrimination
4. Privacy & Independence: there is no logical reason for the state to know about your personal finances. More freedom and rights breeds a better economy, which lifts people out of misery, it's the foundation of the highly successful American experiment. 


We believe the current tax system is unfair, immoral and unsustainable. Too many people are not paying their fair share. We aim to replace all government taxes with a simple, equal and fair tax for everyone. 

Fact 1: 20% of taxable Americans pay NO federal income taxes, while also receiving benefits.
Fact 2: 20% of taxable Americans pay 84% of all federal income tax received. 
Fact 3: In 2017, 50% of Americans paid 97% of all taxes collected. Half of all Americans together contributed almost nothing (3%). 

We believe taxes are a necessary and indispensable part of a functional democracy. Taxes are only universally despised because they are too far removed from their benefits. We understand that taxes as they are today were not born from either a proper theoretical foundation, nor experimental foundation, nor scientific or economic consensus. They have been cobbled together by history and politics, and wrongly so.

People don't despise spending money. People enjoy spending money when the reward/value ratio of what they are buying is high. People gamble in casinos, knowing that the probability of winning is against them. Yet they enjoy it, and engage in it repeatedly even if they lose, because the experience is made to feel valuable. People go to expensive restaurants, and do so again and again if the experience is worth it. People also despise and rage against spending small amounts of money on anything if the value is low. The relationship with taxes is the same. It doesn't matter how much anyone pays in taxes, unless they can directly see what value they are getting for their contribution. In effect, most people think they pay too much in taxes, no matter how little they actually pay comparatively with their neighbors. Unless the efficiency of government is actually tied to the amount paid, no amount on taxes will ever feel just. 

We believe the tax system to be singlehandedly the most important contributor to a nation's wealth and development, and by extension of its individuals. It is the engine which powers government, and is thus the combined economic power of the people. Nothing is more vital to personal freedom than economic independence.

Voting is your voice enabling change in democracy. Taxes are the fuel which powers this change. Yet tax reforms and decisions allocating your taxes are made beyond your control. This power has been co-opted by politicians. They decide how you get taxed, who gets taxed, and where the money goes.


## Who should be taxable? How should they be taxed?
If we no longer tax on income, then the question becomes, who should be contributing to the general costs of organised society. There seems to be a dividing line between two types of services government provides: services which can be taxed by use, and those which cannot. For example, while roads can be taxes variably depending on usage through toll booths, it seems much more difficult to portion out longer term or sporadic costs like the army, or environmental protection or regulatory agencies like the FCC. It also means in this case that we may have make judgment calls onto the particular beneficiaries of certain services. Do only parents benefit from public schools, or does society as a whole, even child-less individuals, benefit from an educated society and peers? 
It seems that if the manner with which individual costs have to be decided upon, then it should be the citizens right and responsability to do so. Any system designed from above is sure to fail and garner resentment from all sides. Those familiar with the history of taxation will no doubt agree 

It seems then that the rules which decide who should be taxed can be put up to democratic vote, and in this way allow for both federal and local taxes to be levied in the matter which best suits either case and in accordance with the sound principles of federalism. In the same manner, the amounts taxable for each upcoming budget can also be a result of direct involvment by citizens. It seems unlikely that direct democracy can be effective if citizen were to be allowed to pay voluntarily and decide what to pay for, as the general public is far removed from the complexity of much of the work government undertakes. However, should citizens receive a yearly breakdown of their personal contribution to each item of the budget, they will then better be equipped to tell their elected officials if they agree with the amounts being spent...it is in fact their money. That fact is hard to keep track of when millions of contributors are pooled, which is where government waste begins.

While the ultimate breakdown, as explained above, should and will come from consensus, we can begin with a simplified initial proposal. 

## Who is taxable under Equal Share: 
1. Anyone with the right to vote?
2. Perhaps active military personel should be exempt? 

## What happens if you don't pay? 
With taxes based on income, when someone with no income can just pay no taxes, the rest of society must make up the difference. There are just three cases to account for:
1. Those unable to be productive. Children, the mentally unfit, the physically unfit, the elderly. 
2. Those who choose to be without income. 
3. Those who are momentarily and in a state without income. In training, undergoing education, momentarily unimployed. 

People in case 1, once the rules for determining who falls whithin that category exactly, can be ommited from the population. They shall pay no taxes.

Case 2 is problematic. There are many reasons why someone might want to be without income, on both ends of the wealth spectrum. Someone financially independent, with acquired wealth, might choose to stop working. Someone poor might also choose, and it would be both random and arbitrary to hold judgment over one vs the other, after all wealth is based on the opinion as to what has value, and what life is meant to accomplish, both too complex to be resolved here. The questions then become:
1. Should people who can contribute but choose not to also be given the benefits of society? Should they be able to freely enjoy roads and security, without charge? 
2. How many of those people can society support before collapsing? 
3. Should this behavior be de-incentivized?
Under the current income-based taxation, not only are those people not taxed at all, but they also receive significant benefits as part of redestribution schemes. 
Perhaps those who do not contribute to society should simply lose their right to vote for the upcoming year/election, as in ancient Greece? 
The mere idea will undoubtedly being strong condemnation from people with a very short view of history, and who consider the right to vote a fundamental right. Yet for this right to even exist, in order for the polling place to exist, and roads to get to the polling place, and the position of the elected official you are voting for to exist, someone needs to pay taxes. Years ago, only the rich paid taxes, and only the rich got to vote. Now only the rich pay taxes, yet everyone gets to vote. Not only that, but the poor, who receive more than they provide, are easily used by left-wing politicians to gain power. When you have no skin in the game, all rights afforded, and nothing to lose, why not always demand more? There is a basic inequality in gaining something for nothing while your neighbors pay. 


Case 3 is also problematic, as the wrong incentives set up in case 2 might increase the likelihood of case 3. It begs the question: do people in a group have the right to be unproductive?(people who can be, outside the group in case 1) How far does that right extend? This is based on the reality that paying taxes can't be voluntary...else no one might pay at all, as dictates the tragedy of the commons. There must be consequences for not contributing. On an income-based system, taxes reduce to zero for those without income, and grow proportionally. With a flat equalshare tax, those without income could ask for an be given a rebate, based on their ability to pay. Is there any practical difference? Huge. The difference is that currently the poorest are receiving services subsidized by the rich, and hate them for doing so. Under EqualShare, they can apply for and receive a rebate, which changes little in practice, but changes everything in intent. EqualShare aims to address reality, not punish or harm anyone. The poor have nothing to fear from EqualShare, and in fact everything to gain. Communities would be better equipped to understand and tailor their taxes to their constituents, programs would better allocate funds where needed. There is nothing to take from those who have too little, and by now we understand fully that the worst policy is to reduce opportunity. 
In effect, we should be able to set a standard for how much people should put away towards their Equalshare based on small income.  
For a yearly EqualShare of $12000:
Monthly: $1000. 
Minimum Rent: $800
Living expenses: $2000
It follows that anyone making over $4000/month, or $48000 should be able to pay their fair share of taxes. Anyone making less should be able to apply for a rebate. 

The goal of EqualShare is to balance equality, personal freedom and societal participation. Its consequences should be a cohesive and united community of people, all people, working together to advance their development together. It simply applies the well proven rules of the free market towards taxes and government involvement. People who receive something for nothing have no incentive to care for it. People who are forced to pay for everyone else end up resenting them. Oppress a community more and more, and they end up fleeing, which is what the wealthy are forced to do. We currently put people in prison for  "tax-evasion", even if those people have paid more taxes in their lifetime than a million others put together. It's a barbaric and unjust practice. It's an inhuman and morally unjust practice. It needs to stop, today. 



On the idea that an EqualShare tax will somehow alienate the poor who cannot afford it:
1. Actually just the opposite. While it seems outlandish on year 1, since many people do not have a reserve of $12k to contribute, as should be their fair share. But by making this a required and compulsory cost of living for everyone, it will raise the standard of living of everyone. Wages will naturally increase to offset this cost. This is not hard on the companies who employ them, as their corporate taxes will have significantly reduced, from 21%, to a single contribution of $12k. I would argue that the EqualShare tax will do more to raise the wages of the poor than the minimum wage does. By giving the poorest a free pass, we are actually not helping anyone. We have set up a system in which people start their economic lives with every right and privilege afforded by taxes, but without having to pay for them. It follows that every subsequent paycheck is a disappointing affair, where the government feels as a thief, when in fact it is the opposite. People distrust and blame their government, rather than recognize the gifts they have been given. In the same way, 99% on the street today will tell you that their taxes are too high, while the rich pay less than they should, while the opposite is actually true. The factual truth is that the rich are currently paying for and subsidizing the poor, year after year. If you paid less than $15-$12k in taxes last year, someone else paid your taxes for you, and that person is being portrayed by the left and the media as a tax evador. Let's be honest and factual, you are the tax evador, they are the responsible citizen. Without you, nothing bad happens, without them, organized society breaks down.
2. Let's identify the actual problem. Too much spending. Too high taxes..too many people who can't afford to pay. It's a fun idea to think you can just take from those who have indefinitely, but you can't base a society, especially not a democracy, on this idea. I would venture that many of the current problems in our democratic society stem from this obviously simplistic idea. Low engagement in democracy, government inefficiency, political corruption, all stem from an unjust tax system which leads to strong imbalences of power. When the fair EqualShare tax is implemented, here are some likely scenarios:
A. Citizen will dramatically cut government spending. The only reason government budgets are so high, is that a small segment of the population (the most highly productive) is being unjustly robbed and pillaged. 80% of people don't pay their fair share of taxes,and thus have no incentive whatsoever to curb spending. Government spending is pooled, and thus too removed from common citizen. None of us understand billions and trillions. We deal in dollars and cents. Ask me if I would like to spend $3, my $3, to have a military next year, and I can understand that. 
B. Government power back in the hands of the people, all people equally. Politicians on the left will see this prognostic as a bad thing...people cutting government spending, how horrible...yes horrible for them, but good for the people. Could they argue that citizen deciding what they would like their government to spend is a bad thing? No. What they are against is loosing their power. Right now the left is on power because they control the purse, and dole out favors to the overwhelming majority of citizen who don't contribute fairly. One government program here, another government program there...all from the purse of those who actually contribute. It's highway robbery. They position themselves as Robin Hood, when they are actually the troll under the bridge. They thrive on division; rather than thank the rich, who are making it all possible, they win by creating a milieu of contempt and hate against them. The only people who have something to lose from an EqualShare tax are not our poorer citizen, it's hipocritical socialist politicians in their endless search for power. Marxists don't love poor people, they hate the rich. There is a big difference. They envy the rich, and create hate in order to win power. Patrisse Cullors, a trained Marxist, now has her mansions in beautiful places, and quickly exits "the movement". How convenient. 
3. Once citizen have taken control back from politicians who abuse them, taxes will be lower, and thus more people will afford to contribute. The math of combined action is tremendously powerful...the more citizen contribute, the lower are the costs for everyone. 




## How to tax Corporations? 
We can choose to either not tax Corporations at all, or tax them as a single individual. What is the rationale behind taxing corporations? Other than taking money where it lies, which seems to be the general historical reason for most taxes, I can find none. Many corporations today exist for the sole reason of evading the exessive taxing on the rich. With EqualShare, this would dissapear overnight. All the complications tied to taxing enterprises small and large, and the lost productivity ,would dissapear overnight, making the country who implements EqualShare a huge attractor for international business. 

## On Paying more than your EqualShare. 
The principal idea of equalshare is that since everyone receives more of less the same from government, everyone should be required to contribute equally. This does not mean you cannot contribute more if you want to. Wealthy individuals who wish to contribute more should be able to, and they should have the right to allocate to a certain budget item if they deem it more important. They should also be able to pay the Equalshare of others, freeing them of their requirements.  

## Why is EqualShare good for the poor?
Currently our government's tax system is based on grabbing money wherever it is to be found. The rich, consumption and vices, imports...there is no rhyme or logic other than to litterally find a pool of money, and taxing it. Politicians propose new taxes to fund new ideas, all outside the real control of citizen. There are only two control mechanisms to prevent runaway budgets. 
1. Fiscally conservative elected officials, who refuse to endorse higher taxes on their constituents. 
2. Citizen not re-electing officials on the basis on their fiscal record. 
And yet, the US has a runaway deficit, because it is much easier for politicians to tax and do, than to be thrifty and efficient with the money they are given. EqualShare is the only tax system which cuts this problem at the root, ensuring participatory democracy and the ability for citizen to determine their country's fiscal future...and therby their future. Who suffers from a runaway deficit? It's the poor. The wealthy always have exit options...who remains behind to cope with poor fiscal responsability are the most vulnerable. Equalshare main goal is to put common sense back into government, and improve government efficiency. The current EqualShare amount is based on years of grift.

## The smokescreen of percentages
So deep runs the con that most people need a 30 minute lecture on tax history to even grasp the concept of EqualShare and its value. All this stems from the use of percentual tax rates, rather than actual dollars and cents. The most common response you are likely to get when explaining the problems with the current tax system is: "But the rich already pay less than the poor...using adjusted percentages based on income..." 


## General Tendings in Free Market Manipulation
Free markets always naturally evolve to facilitate transactions, and people will always tend towards limiting and restricting freedoms on markets in order to increase their personal circumstances. Every attempts to regulate or limit the natural workings of free markets is driven not by the "stated intentions" of person or group attempting to change the market, but by a personal strive for more power, influence, security, or wealth. The advantages gained by regulating/restricting/over-seeing/manipulating free markets should always be weighed against their potential downsides. Since the importance of competition in free markets is generally not understood by the general public, just as control theory and stochastic control is not taught to or understood by many people, it's always much harder to predict the outcome of free market manipulation than it is to taut the benefits of any proposed benefits.
Perhaps a framework can be proposed to lay out the probabilistic outcomes of proposed policy changes in less-biased ways that the current methods. First is must be recognized that the people who propose changes to free markets **ALWAYS** do so for personal gain, and not the **proposed** intention. In essense, we should recognise and learn to always dissasociate the **PROPOSED INTENT** of the policy change from the unstated or **REAL INTENT**. I am not saying that this is always a nefarious or machiavellian plot. It's often due to a complete mis-understanding or ignorance of how markets function. Sometimes, it's naivete. For example, someone who is arguing for higher minimum wages mandated by law could be:
1. ignorant of the fact that it will increase the number of people who are unemployable
2. in a personal position who's performance is evaluated by how much they can increase minumum wages (union reps, politicians...)
3. etc...
In short, they are focused and single-minded in their approach, in that their ONLY consideration is how much the people around them are getting paid. They disregard every other group, individual, and society at large, for which higher minimum wages are extremely hurtful.

### A Framework for identifying free-market change proposals
1. State the proposal. e.g. "Raise the minimum wage mandated by law to $15/h"
2. State the **proposed intent** , the purpose. e.g. "A better quality of life for wage workers"
3. Propose potential **real intents**. Perhaps "results" should be used rather than "intents" ? Should the actors be removed from the equation or are they intrinsic to the problem?
   a. gain political power by appeasing a large % of service workers..
   b. 

** Caveat, while 1 & 2 can be proposed by the party making the proposal, items 3... should be evaluated by an unbiased third party.


## Inflation
Since inflation is a tax which citizen pay but have no vote on, the M2 money supply or the deficit must be voted on and controlled by the people.
